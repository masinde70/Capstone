# Healthcare

## EHR/EMR
Electronic Health records or Electronic Medical Records
data is the data being collected when we see a doctor, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy, or even from a visit to the dentist. 

This data is used for a variety of use-cases. From personalizing healthcare to discovering novel drugs and treatments to helping providers diagnose patients better and reduce medical errors.

## Definition
The objective of the  project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

## The dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle

ref:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

## Project Statement

Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?


## Benchmark model
The model going to be is used in this project is Autogluon or Classification
algorithm since it is a classification problem.


## Metrics
A set of evaluation metrics

 - The confusion matrix is a technique used for summarizing the performance     of a classification algorithm i.e. it has binary outputs.
 - Classification Report
 -  ROC - AUC
    ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve tells us about how good the model can distinguish between two things (e.g If a patient has a disease or no). Better models can accurately distinguish between the two. Whereas, a poor model will have difficulties in distinguishing between the two
