Electronic Health records or Electronic Medical Records data is the data
being collected when we see a doctor, pick up a prescription at the
pharmacy, or even from a visit to the dentist.

This data is used for a variety of use-cases. From personalizing
healthcare to discovering novel drugs and treatments to helping
providers diagnose patients better and reduce medical errors.

Diabetes mellitus, or simply diabetes, is a leading non-communicable
disease (NCD) globally, almost doubling in cases since 1980. It is a
chronic illness that develops either when the pancreas are not able to
generate sufficient insulin or when the body does not utilize the
insulin produced effectively. There is no cure for this disease.
Diabetes is thought to result from a combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Several risk factors that are attributed to
diabetes include ethnicity, family history of diabetes, age, excess
weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and smoking. In addition to
this, the absence of early detection of diabetes has been known to
contribute to the development of other chronic diseases such as kidney
disease.


## About Dataset
### Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
